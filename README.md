# Compiler Project

Building a Compiler using a tutorial will try and change the language later but currently runs a custom language called "Teeny Tiny"

As of writing this starting part 2 of the tutorial

Completed last time was Lexing, which breaks the input code into small pieces called tokens,

presumably part 2 is Parsing, which verifies that the tokens are in an order that our language allows,

and presumably part 3 is Emitting, which produces the appropriate C code.
